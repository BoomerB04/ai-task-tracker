🆘 Troubleshooting
<details> <summary><b>🔄 Sync not working</b></summary>
Ensure your GitHub Gist URL ends with /raw/my-tasks.json
Check that your Gist is public or you're using the correct raw URL
Try creating a new Gist if the old one isn't working
</details> <details> <summary><b>📱 App won't load</b></summary>
Try refreshing the page (Ctrl+R or Cmd+R)
Clear browser cache and cookies
Make sure you're using a modern browser (Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge)
</details> <details> <summary><b>🔗 Lost sync URL</b></summary>
If you have a GitHub account: Check your Gists at gist.github.com
If anonymous: Unfortunately, the data cannot be recovered
This is why we recommend the GitHub account option!
</details> <details> <summary><b>🤖 AI parsing fails</b></summary>
The AI feature requires setting up sync first
Make sure you have an internet connection
Try simpler language: "Task name, due date, priority"
